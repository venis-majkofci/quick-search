## Description

Quick-Search is a cross-platform application built with Electron that allows you to perform quick searches with ease. Simply open the application using the shortcut `CommandOrControl+Shift+S` and enter the text or link you want to search. It will open in the browser of your choice, which can be selected on the first launch or by clicking the small icon in the top right corner of the application window.

The supported browsers are:

| Browser            | Windows | macOS | Linux |
|--------------------|---------|-------|-------|
| Chrome             |   ✓     |   ✓   |   ✓   |
| Firefox            |   ✓     |   ✓   |   ✓   |
| Opera              |   ✓     |   ✓   |   ✓   |
| Brave              |   ✓     |   ✓   |   ✓   |
| Microsoft Edge     |   ✓     |   -   |   -   |
| Safari             |   -     |   ✓   |   -   |

The supported search engines are:

- Google
- Bing
- Yahoo
